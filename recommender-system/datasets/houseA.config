#This dataset has 14 binary sensors, i.e. at most 14 services are typically available concurrently. The only anomaly is
#right at the beginning of the dataset, where the current status of the sensors are not known, in this case more than 14
#services can be recommended. However, there will be very few instances where this is the case and recommendation results
#will be therefore be statistically insignificant.
