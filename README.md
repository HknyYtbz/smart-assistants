Smart assistants for smart homes
=============================

This repository contains some of the code I developed while working on my PhD thesis [1].
The aim of the thesis was to increase the usability of smart homes and to simplify installation and
configuration procedures.

The repository contains at the moment only the sources for one of the assistants that are proposed in the thesis,
a smart home recommender system that learns user habits, making it possible to build much simpler home interfaces.
The remaining code for the other assistants might be added later.
